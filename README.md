# Alien Invasion

## Description
Travel throughout multiple planets collecting coins and getting by enemies. Alien Invasion includes a total of 2 levels, the first being located on a planet named 'Earth'. In order to complete the first level, you will need to be able to complete difficult jumps and outsmart enemies. During the second level, you will travel into space to one of Jupiters 67 moons. Here, the gravity level is much lower than on the planet before so in order to collect coins, you will need to be able to accurately land long jumps and evade more enemies.
